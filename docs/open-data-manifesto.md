## Better Data for the NHS

Operational research is key to understanding what works in the NHS. However the methods and code used to carry out this research are rarely seen in public. Standards are variable. One-off point-and-click analytics are common. This living document aims to start a discussion about best practice for research and analysis using NHS data. Send us your feedback!

### Publish everything
* **Share** your methods and code, so other teams can review it and learn.
* Permit other people to **re-use** your code and content.
* Publish **imperfect** code fearlessly.
* Work in public from the **start** where possible.


### Make collaboration easy
* Use Jupyter notebooks or R Markdown to **tell a story** for generalists _and_ analysts.
* Do the hard work to make it **easy** for others to run the code.
* Use code **comments** to inform a technical audience.
* **Document** key decisions alongside your code.
* Maintain a single **repository** for each project, with a _README_.
* Develop a **supportive** culture.

### Automate tasks with code where possible
* Use **scripts**, not point-and-click tools.
* Make **live** dashboards rather than occasional reports.
* Turn recurring work into **libraries** and share them.

### Use coders' best practice
* Do regular code **reviews**.
* Use **version control**.
* Write **tests** for your code.
* Help develop and follow local **conventions** around coding.
