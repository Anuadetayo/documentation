After the data controller has [approved your project](https://www.opensafely.org/onboarding-new-users/), we will add any Github usernames listed in your approval to our `opensafely` Github organisation.  We also will transfer your existing OpenSAFELY study repository (if you have one) into the same organisation. This allows OpenSAFELY to enforce certain security standards, such as [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

Additionally, the OpenSAFELY framework requires a user to be a member of the `opensafely` Github organisation in order to [run jobs in the secure backends](job-server.md).
