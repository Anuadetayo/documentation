# ehrQL tutorial

---8<-- 'includes/data-builder-danger-header.md'

## Audience

This tutorial is aimed at:

* **new users of Data Builder**
  who wish to write dataset definitions
  to extract data from OpenSAFELY backends
* **developers involved in operating data backends**
  who wish to understand more about how OpenSAFELY backends
  are accessed by users

### Requirements

#### Background knowledge

The current implementation of ehrQL is based on Python,
but the syntax used is relatively simple.

This tutorial assumes that you have a little familiarity with programming or scripted data analysis,
whether that is in Python, R, Stata or any other language.

Familiarity with:

* OpenSAFELY
* How [electronic healthcare records are structured](data-sources/intro.md)

would also be helpful,
but is *not* essential.
