## Timings

Basic timing information is available from job and job request detail pages, for example:

![Timings for job request 8676](images/job_request_8676_timings.png)

The runtime for a job request is the combined runtime for all completed jobs of a job request, i.e. the runtime of each completed job is added together.

## Monitoring
