# Adding an OpenSAFELY paper to OpenSAFELY.org

We are very keen to compile all pre-printed and published OpenSAFELY studies on [opensafely.org](https://www.opensafely.org).

To do this, we require the following information:

* the full title
* the date the paper was published on the journal's website
* the authors
* the full citation
* a short description
* the DOI
* the name of the journal
* the URL of the associated OpenSAFELY repository
* the number of the associated OpenSAFELY project (see the "[Approved Projects](https://www.opensafely.org/approved-projects/)" page)

If the paper has an accompanying preprint,
then we also require the following information about the accompanying preprint:

* the full title
* the DOI
* the URL
