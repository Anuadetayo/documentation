# Adding an OpenSAFELY paper to OpenSAFELY.org

We are very keen to compile all pre-printed and published OpenSAFELY studies on [the OpenSAFELY website](https://www.opensafely.org/research).

We have provided a template file to help you provide this information to us in the most helpful format. The template can be previewed in full below.

Please [download the template](/paper_template.txt), fill it in (being careful not to change the format), and send it to your co-pilot.



```yaml
