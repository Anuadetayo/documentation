**Here is some information about the new process for telling us about changes to your project:**

**Project Update Form** 

When leaving your research position or if you are ending a project, a step by step guide for handing over a **‘single’** OpenSAFELY approved project will need to be adhered to by completing a [Project Update Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqABEzk6sfmjO1Fyekj55aChwaVm6qHDw5A1QgR7R84/edit). Completion of this form is required for any project that meets any of the following circumstances: 

  **1. One or more researchers are leaving their research position at their home institution.**
  **2. One or more roles within the project need to be handed over (i.e study lead, researcher, etc,.)**
  **3. The project can no longer continue i.e the project needs to be either postponed, or retired.** 
  **4. The project is completed.** 

This form must be returned by the Study Lead. If you are not the study lead, this form must be completed in collaboration with them (or as a minimum review by). For any questions that arise while filling in this form, researchers are advised to contact their Co-pilot in the first instance, or the OpenSAFELY Research Administrator via the applications inbox applications@opensafely.org.
