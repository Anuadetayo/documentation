OpenSAFELY is a rapidly changing platform and the user documentation should be updated frequently to keep pace.
If you are an OpenSAFELY user and want to contribute corrections, clarifications, or new materials to the documentation, please do!
You can either:

* Suggest improvements in an [issue](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/issues).
* Run the documentation [in GitHub Codespaces](#running-in-github-codespaces) for editing.
* Clone [the repo](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation) locally, make edits on a new branch, then create a pull request for it.
* [Edit directly on GitHub](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/tree/main/docs) ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)), making sure to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".

Do not commit changes directly to the main branch.

## Running in GitHub Codespaces

Clicking the button below will open a codespace
that allows you to run and edit the site.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/opensafely/documentation)

When you see "Your application running on port 8910 is available",
you can click "Open in Browser" to see a preview,
and edit the content files in `docs/` to change the content.
It may take a few seconds for changes you make to appear.

## Documentation style

When adding or revising text, use [Semantic Line Breaks](https://sembr.org/) rather than fixed length lines.
With semantic line breaks, the diff is more concise and easier to interpret than with fixed length lines,
where a single change can propagate through a whole paragraph.
