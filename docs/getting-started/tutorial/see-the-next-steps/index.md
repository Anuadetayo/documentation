Congratulations! You've covered all the basics that you need to develop a study
on your own computer, verify that it can run against real data, and publish it
to GitHub.

To proceed from here,
there is an application process to follow,
and more about OpenSAFELY that you will need to learn.

## Applying for OpenSAFELY access

To write a real study and run it against actual patient data, you will first need to get permission for your project from the data controllers for the NHS England OpenSAFELY COVID-19 service.
