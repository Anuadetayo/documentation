To use OpenSAFELY, you must have a GitHub account. GitHub is a widely-used
website for storing and collaborating on software, using the version control
software `git`. GitHub is where your open, reproducible research will be
published.

This tutorial also uses GitHub Codespaces to work with OpenSAFELY.

## Creating a GitHub account

!!! note
    If you already have a GitHub account,
    you can use that account.

If you do not already have a GitHub account, you should create one
first.

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and click the "Sign up" button.
You will have to provide an email address and password. GitHub will
also send you a confirmation email containing a link that you need
to visit to confirm your account.

## Securing your GitHub account

We recommend that you [secure your GitHub account with two-factor
authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).
