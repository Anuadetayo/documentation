## Tidy up

If you close a codespace in your browser, it still continues running. So, once you've finished using your codespace, you can delete it.

There's more information about how to delete your codespace, and why you should delete any codespaces you no longer need, in [GitHub's documentation on deleting a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/deleting-a-codespace).

It's important to note that saving files in your codespace only ensures that changes persist in that codespace's storage. So, when you delete your codespace, any changes will be lost unless they are pushed to the remote repository that GitHub hosts.

!!! warning
    By default, codespaces are automatically deleted after a period of inactivity and any changes not pushed to the remote GitHub repository will be lost.
    For the `opensafely` organization,
    this period is 30 days.
