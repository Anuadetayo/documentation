## Tidy up

If you close a Codespace in your browser, it still continues running. So, once you've finished using your Codespace, you can delete it.

There's information about how to do this on our [Codespaces](../../how-to/use-github-codespaces-in-your-project/index.md#how-to-delete-a-codespace) page.
