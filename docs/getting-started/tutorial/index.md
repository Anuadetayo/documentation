In the tutorial, we will create a study that uses dummy patient data.
We will:

1. Create a GitHub account
1. Create a new repository
1. Create a study
1. Run the study in a local environment
1. Update the study
1. Run the study in a testing environment

Because the study uses dummy patient data, anyone can complete the tutorial.
All we need is an up to date web browser and an internet connection.
