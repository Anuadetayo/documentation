## Introduction

OpenSAFELY is designed to allow you to do your analytic work on your own
computer, without ever having to access the real, sensitive, patient-level data.

We ask all potential collaborators to successfully complete this tutorial,
before applying to run their project against real data.

## Learning outcome

This tutorial will walk you through the minimum steps needed to run an
OpenSAFELY-compliant study against "dummy" (randomly-generated) patient data.

You will:

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Create a new repository
3. Create a study
4. Run the study in a local environment
5. Update the study
6. Run the study in a testing environment

Because the study uses dummy patient data, anyone can complete the tutorial.

Please don't be afraid to ask questions in our [Q&A
forum](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions)!

## Requirements

The requirements for this tutorial are minimal.

You will need a computer with:

* an up-to-date web browser
* an internet connection

The tutorial will be completed in the GitHub Codespaces environment.
Free GitHub accounts are given a monthly quota of Codespaces.
If you do not have a GitHub account,
we will create one in this tutorial.
