Here, you'll copy our OpenSAFELY research template to your own GitHub
account, for developing your own study:

1. Click on the link below to create new repository based on our template.
   You may need to log in to GitHub if you are not already logged in:
   <br><a href="https://github.com/opensafely/research-template/generate" target="_blank">https://github.com/opensafely/research-template/generate</a>.
1. Leave the "Include all branches" option unchecked.
1. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu, and select your GitHub account as the owner.
1. Enter `opensafely-getting-started` as the name for your repository.
1. Enter "The OpenSAFELY getting started tutorial" as the description of your repository.
1. Choose "Public" as [repository visibility](../../../repositories.md#repository-visibility).
   ![Entering a description and choosing to make a repository public or private, when creating a repository from the research template.](../../../images/getting-started-create-repository-public-private.png)
1. Click **Create repository from template**
1. The new GitHub repository will take a moment to initialise, as it is running
   some setup in background. Wait about 1 minute, then reload the page, and you
   should see the README displayed now reflects the name you gave to the new
   repository.

   If you see `${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME}` in your README, the repo is not yet initialised, wait a few seconds longer and reload.
