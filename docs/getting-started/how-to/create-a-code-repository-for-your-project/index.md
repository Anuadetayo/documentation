## Create a code repository for your project

!!! info
    A "code repository" is where code gets published on GitHub.
    This is not to be confused with a codespace.

    A codespace refers specifically to a virtual machine environment,
    that contains a *copy* of your repository code to work on.

You only need to create a code repository once for a particular project.

Create a new research code repository based on the research template.

1. In your web browser,
   go to the [research code template repository](https://github.com/opensafely/research-template).
1. Click the "Use this template" button
   to begin the process of creating a new research code repository for you to work on.
   The screenshot below shows this.

There are several options given
when creating a new repository from a template.

Here is a quick explanation of the options:

* If you are creating a repository for an OpenSAFELY project,
  you should choose `opensafely` as the repository owner.
* If you are creating a repository for testing OpenSAFELY out,
  you should choose *your own GitHub user account* as the repository owner.
* You can enter any name and description that you choose for your repository.
* You can choose whether the repository visibility is public or private.
* You do not need to select "Include all branches".
* You can ignore the mention of "GitHub Apps from GitHub Marketplace"
  in GitHub's instructions for creating a new repository from a template.

If you are unsure of what to do,
refer to GitHub's step-by-step instructions for [creating a new repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

!!! warning
    Creating a repository owned by your GitHub user account
    will enable you to:

    * work on your OpenSAFELY research code in Codespaces
    * check that your research code works with the OpenSAFELY platform

    **It will not allow you to run code on OpenSAFELY's platform.**

    For that, you would have to request that your repository is transferred to the `opensafely` organization.

    Approved OpenSAFELY users are able to create a repository within the `opensafely` organization directly.
