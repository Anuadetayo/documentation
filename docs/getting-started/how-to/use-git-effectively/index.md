This page links to resources that describe how to use Git effectively.

## Using Git with `git`

The `git` command-line tool has a large number of commands.
However, only a small number are important and commonly used.
These are summarised in GitHub's "[Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)".

## Using Git with VS Code

VS Code's Source Control view provides a visual interface to important and commonly used commands.
For more information, see the "[Introduction to Git in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git)" page in VS Code's docs.
