The how-to guides in this section provide guidance
for setting up and running the software required for OpenSAFELY.

## New users

!!! note
    We strongly recommend the use of GitHub Codespaces for working with OpenSAFELY, at least initially.
    GitHub Codespaces does not require any local software installation,
    meaning you can start working in a web browser almost immediately.

* Refer to the [guidance for using GitHub Codespaces](../../../github-codespaces.md).

## Experienced users

!!! info

    If you are an experienced OpenSAFELY user who:

    * has administrative access to their computers
    * wants to run OpenSAFELY on their own computer,
      instead of in GitHub Codespaces

    we provide guides on installing the software required for OpenSAFELY on your own machine.

Consult the relevant sections for the operating system you use:

* [Windows](../../../install-windows.md)
* [macOS](../../../install-macos.md)
* [Linux](../../../install-linux.md)

## All users

All users should be familiar with the OpenSAFELY CLI.

* Refer to the [guidance for the OpenSAFELY CLI](../../../opensafely-cli.md)
