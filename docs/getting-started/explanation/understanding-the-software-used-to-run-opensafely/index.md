# Understanding the software used to run OpenSAFELY

## Why OpenSAFELY requires several pieces of installed software to run

Some of the software needed is so you can execute code on your computer
in **exactly the same way** it is run in the secure environment: even a slight
mismatch in the versions of the software could cause bugs and delays.

OpenSAFELY is also designed to encourage analysts to adopt best-practice
software development processes, like using `git` for version control.

If you're new to these concepts, there may be quite a lot to learn, and you'll need
to use further software to work with them. The investment will be worthwhile:
you'll find your software quality and efficiency will benefit hugely.

!!! note
    If you use the OpenSAFELY GitHub Codespaces environment,
    all of the required software is already installed for you.
