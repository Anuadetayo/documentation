### Academic Journal Destination: Plan S and OpenSAFELY

[Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) is an initiative for Open Access publishing. Plan S requires that scientific publications that result from research funded by public grants must be published in compliant Open Access journals or platforms. Wellcome are a core funder of the OpenSAFELY platform, therefore we ask that academic outputs comply with Wellcome's Plan S requirements for journal publication. It is likely that teams will be required to comply with this for other reasons, such as receiving funding from NIHR / UKRI. For further details see [openaccess.ox.ac.uk/wellcome](https://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/wellcome).

### How do I check journal open access compliance?

Before you submit a paper to a journal, please check open access arrangements. 

[journalcheckertool.org](https://journalcheckertool.org) is our recommended tool for checking journal compliance.

If you have any questions, please ask your co-pilot and post in the opensafely-users slack channel.
