# Visual Studio Code as a code editor

When writing code in the OpenSAFELY framework, a code editor will help.
GitHub users already use Visual Studio Code by default in a GitHub codespace.

Visual Studio Code is also available free of charge for Windows, macOS
and Linux. If you are working on your own computer and **not** in
GitHub, and are already comfortable using another code editor, then that
editor will be suitable.

There are several [short videos and written
guides](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#first-steps) elsewhere on how
to use more of Visual Studio Code's features.

## Installing Visual Studio Code

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Opening a research repository in Visual Studio Code

Start Visual Studio Code and use the menu to open a clone of your research repository
(**File > Open Folder...**)
