When you are ready to publish your report, several steps should be followed:

* It must be checked by NHSE (may simply reference the corresponding paper where applicable). Contact [publications@opensafely.org](mailto:publications@opensafely.org).
* Send your report to your co-pilot so they can review it.
* Make sure the linked code repository is also public and has gone through the [checking process](../project-completion.md).
