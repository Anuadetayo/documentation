## Create a DOI
All published reports should have a DOI.
You will need your own [CrossRef user credentials](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/member-setup/account-credentials/) in order to register DOIs.

How to create and add a DOI:

1. Make sure your report is published and not still draft. (CrossRef requires that all DOIs link to a landing page which is publicly accessible.)
2. Find the suggested DOI on the admin page for your report.
3. Go to the [CrossRef Web Deposit page](https://apps.crossref.org/webDeposit/) and fill in the basic information:
  - select `Report` as the Data Type.
  - Enter the suggested DOI from your report, prefixed with our organisation code: `10.53764/xxxxxxxxxxxx`.
  - Add the URL for the report.
  - `OpenSAFELY` as Publisher.
  - Authors have to be added one-by-one so you may wish to use `The OpenSAFELY Collaborative` in place of some or all authors, if appropriate.
  - Use the report's first publication date as the `online` publication date (`Print` publication date can be left blank).
4. Submit DOI, you'll then be prompted for your login credentials and then your/an email address.
5. Enter the DOI URL in the `DOI` field (`https://doi.org/10.53764/xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

See the [Crossref documentation](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/member-setup/web-deposit-form/) for more information.
