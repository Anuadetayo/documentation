## Glossary
* **Underlying cause of death (icd10u)** A cause code that identifies the medical condition judged to be the underlying cause of death according to the rules of the _10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases_. This field appears once for each cause coded routine and inquest death (deaths at age 28 days and over). This code is generally known as 'the cause of death' and is used in single cause tabulations and analyses. The death is assigned the ICD10U code on the basis of ICD-10 codes allocated to the death by the MICAR program. A coder may also manually assign these codes to a death record.
* **Primary / secondary cause of death** These are not concepts used in ONS cause of death data. There is the underlying cause, and then a list of up to 15 medical conditions (`ICD10001` to `ICD10015`, given as ICD-10 codes) mentioned on the death certificate. These codes are not ordered meaningfully.
