The UK Renal Registry (UKRR) contains data on patients under secondary renal care (advanced chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5, dialysis, and kidney transplantation). The purpose of the UKRR is to audit secondary kidney 
care delivery in the UK especially dialysis and kidney transplant. Data is collected from many different renal IT systems.
