Research outputs and log files can be viewed from within the
secure environment using Airlock.

The [Airlock documentation](/using-opensafely/viewing-and-releasing-outputs/viewing-and-releasing-with-airlock) provides information on how to
[log in](/using-opensafely/viewing-and-releasing-outputs/viewing-and-releasing-with-airlock/how-tos/access-airlock/) to Airlock and how to [view moderately sensitive workspace outputs](/using-opensafely/viewing-and-releasing-outputs/viewing-and-releasing-with-airlock/how-tos/view-workspace-files/).

## Log files

In addition to workspace output files, you can also view log
files from your jobs on Airlock (including logs from failed
jobs).

To view log files, [navigate to your workspace](/using-opensafely/viewing-and-releasing-outputs/viewing-and-releasing-with-airlock/how-tos/view-workspace-files/) in Airlock.
Log files are found in the `metadata/` folder in your workspace,
and are named with the name of the action from the `project.yaml` file.
